### Citation

Nistor, A., Song, L., Marinov, D., & Lu, S. (2013, May). Toddler: Detecting performance problems via similar memory-access patterns. In Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Software Engineering (pp. 562-571). IEEE Press. [Paper link](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486862).

### Summary

Give a 3-4 sentence summary of the paper for quick reference.

### Keywords

* ii1. Performance bug: Bugs responsible for significant performance degradation (e.g. feeling sluggish).
* ii2. Functional bugs: Bugs responsible for reduced functionality in a software project.
* ii3. Automated oracle: A program that detects if a test triggers a bug (e.g. an ``assertion`` in Python).
* ii4.

### Main Items

* iii1. Tutorial materials. The authors provide an overview of standard functional bug test creation:
> To test for functional bugs, developers usually follow three steps: (1) write as many and as diverse tests as allowed by the testing budget, (2) run these tests and use automated oracles (e.g., crashes or assertions) to find which tests fail, and (3) inspect _only_ the failing tests.

 After this very quick tutorial, they then refer to these steps later in the paper when describing their own model for performance bugs. I found this inclusion very useful because I could immediately connect their novel results to the existing models.

* iii2. Motivating statements.
* iii3.
* iii4.
